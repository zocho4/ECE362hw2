****Things to sort out****
 - How does while loop work for reading/writing
 - How to account for leftover bytes...can I XOR strings with uneven number of bytes?

////twist.c////

MAIN
	PARSE the commmand line arguments
	    be sure to:
		- check that the block size is ok
		- defaults are established
	
	OPEN the input file for read only (or use stdin)
	OPEN the output file for write only (or use stdout)

        WHILE (not EOF) //a do-while may be better here
                READ block size number of bytes into buffer from file
		REVERSE bytes into new buffer
		WRITE new buffer contents into output file
		//be sure to properly deal with \0 and \n
        END WHILE
END MAIN



////xor.c////

MAIN
	PARSE the commmand line arguments
        OPEN the input file for read only (or use stdin)
        OPEN the output file for write only (or use stdout)

	WHILE (not EOF)
		READ mask sized block of bytes into read buf from file
		XOR buf with mask and store in write buf
		WRITE write buf to output file
	END WHILE
END MAIN

NO IDEA!!!
